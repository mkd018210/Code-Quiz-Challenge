# Code-Quiz-Challenge
Description.
The application allows the user to test their knowledge on coding termination.

Challenges
Some challenges I faced were getting the start button to work and get the quiz to run.

Future Development
For future development, I want to be sure the quiz runs correctly and that the high scores page coresponds to it.

Motivation
My motivation was to have the quiz help any student that wanted to challange what they have learned and to apply what I have learned.

Success
I didn't have many successes in this project but I know I can come back and fix it as I learn more.

Contributors
Myself as well as help from websites and some class code.
